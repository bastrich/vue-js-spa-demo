<h3>About</h3>
This site is sort of personal portal with articles and materials I've created during my life and would like to share
with other people.

<h3>My inspirations</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Desire to share life-hacks, solutions to technical problems from my experience and other stuff like that with as
        many people as possible
    </li>
    <li>
        I want my thoughts and ideas to be heard by other people, want to have some platform serving that purpose. This
        site
        may be such instrument
    </li>
    <li>
        Sites of my colleagues or other technical experts where they share their experience (e.g.
        <a href="http://yurkins-workshop.ru/">http://yurkins-workshop.ru/</a>
        or <a href="https://eax.me/">https://eax.me/</a>)
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Ways to access my site</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Desktop Web</li>
    <li>Desktop Web with browser accessibility features (like Text To Speech)</li>
    <li>Mobile Web</li>
</ol>

<h3>What did I consider when thinking about usability of my site</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        It should have calm and pleasant color scheme. Visitors shouldn't feel uncomfortable when browsing the site
    </li>
    <li>
        Design in the whole should be minimalistic, shouldn't have a lot of details, so visitors brain won't be
        overloaded
    </li>
    <li>
        Navigation should be as simple and straightforward as possible
    </li>
</ol>


<h3>What did I have to learn/find out when creating my site</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Modern CSS features like Flexbox and Grid Layout. I've been learning CSS about 10 years ago, and I was surprised
        now
        when met those new great and much more comfortable features than using float
    </li>
    <li>
        Mustache JS - nice and useful template engine. It allows getting started fast and provides more than enough
        options
        for my project. Mostly I used official documentation from their Github page
    </li>
    <li>
        Dived a bit deeper to semantic HTML layout. Thought that was a deprecated approach, but looks like it's still
        alive
        and used in many modern web-sites
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>What worked well</h3>
As I already had technical experience in web development, many tasks were easier for me and took less time. Using and
debugging CSS, integration of JS template library were smooth enough. And I didn't have any long blockers or problems I
couldn't resolve.

<h3>What can be improved</h3>
For me the main aspect that can be improved is discipline and planning. I had some plan in the head about a month before
deadline. But it was a little abstract, without concrete steps and milestones.
Finally, I came up with the solution, but it was under deadline pressure, and could be much better if I started earlier
and had more or less detailed plan.
